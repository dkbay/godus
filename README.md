Something the NSA would be proud of.

A plugin that logs chat messages, msg's, mcmmo messages etc. to a central database where it can be stored for use as evidence against players.

Along with more easily being able to identify players who write swear words, or for collecting evidence that wasn't collected at the time of a rule break.
